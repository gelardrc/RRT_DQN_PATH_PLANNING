# Adaptive Path Planning for UAS Fusing Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees and Deep Reinforcement Learning in an Agriculture Dynamic Environment

**Author:** Gabriel G.R Castro

**Abstract** : Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) is a suitable solution for monitoring the growing cultures due to the possibility of covering a large area presented in this kind of scenario and the necessity of periodic monitoring. In inspection and monitoring tasks, the UAS must find an optimal or near optimal collision-free route given initial and target positions. In this sense, path planning strategies are crucial, especially online path planning that can represent the robotâ€™s operational environment or even for controlling purposes. Therefore, this research proposes an online adaptive 3D path planning
solution based on the fusion of Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to be applied in the autonomous trajectory of UAS during the inspection of an olive-growing environment. The proposed framework was tested in a simulated environment
using Gazebo and ROS. The results showed that the proposed solution accomplished the trial for 91.2% of the test environment.

**1 - Requirements :**  <a name="requeriments"></a>

Firsts things first, you need to have installed into your computer (offboard controller) ROS melodic. Just follow the ROS Wiki tutorials above:

>http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu
>
>http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment

With your ROS system installed and catkin space configured, we will install PX4 ros package. Follow the tutorials in PX4 site above : 

(I recommend to install via ubuntu_sim_ros_melodic.sh, and to download Firmware into your catkin space !!)

>https://dev.px4.io/v1.11_noredirect/en/setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.html

Now install mavros (in this work I installed from source, without problem)

>sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-mavros ros-melodic-mavros-extras

Obs : You will probably need to install other standard ros-packges, like rospy and some gazebo messages. Since they fit in any project, you probably will have them already installed into your ros workspace

**2 - Project Structure :**  <a name="structure"></a>

This project has the structure of a catkin-ros package where : 

Directorys:

Models &rarr;  Contain the models used in simulations ( most of them are already in gazebo standard models, but these have little changes)

Launch &rarr;  Has the compiled of nodes you need to use to Start simulations and tests for this project

Scripts &rarr;  Is where the actual python and jupyternotebooks are stored

Worlds  &rarr;  Contain the files that describe the worlds in gazebo simulation

data    &rarr;  Contain some information about the data acquired during tests and simulations

**3 - Scripts files :**  <a name="scripts"></a>

The work has four major pieces of codes, that can be found in scripts directory.

**Alg_trieno_python_simu.ipynb &rarr;** Is the notebook used that actually train the DQN, save and create the file last_brain.pth, that is the DQN saved model.

**agent.py &rarr;** Is where we start all things attached to the agent like sensors, mission messages, actions and so on.....

**world_builder &rarr;** Is the core of the simulation, it started gelo.launch (px4+mavros nodes) and create and actualize the environment in gazebo.

**mission_planner.py &rarr;** That is just a normal RRT implementation, but taking into account the models create in world_builder. It also sends a message to agent.py, with the planned mission.

**4 - Nodes Structure:**  <a name="nodes"></a>

That is how the nodes communicate to each other using ROS messages and topics.

**5 - Run the project**  <a name="run"></a>

> cd your_catkin_workspace
>
> git clone https://github.com/gelardrc/RRT_DQN_PATH_PLANNING.git
>
> copy and paste all /moddels/* to  ~/.gazebo/models  (it's important because world_builder points to ~/.gazebo/models)
>
> copy and paste gelo.launch (maybe you will need to chmod +x gelo.launch ) into PX4-Autopilot/launch
>
> roslaunch px4 gelo.launch  (If you are using px4 package inside catkin, reminder to exports paths, in other to gazebo and ros update paths or just update and source gelo_setup.bash with your own path)

Wait until gazebo opens, and try a takeoff / land commander, to inspect if everything is ok.

> python ./world_builder.py   
>
> python ./mission_planner.py
>
>rosbag record -a
>
> python ./agent.py   

**Obs :** In agent.py you can choose on main function, if you want to test a Dqn or train a Dqn into gazebo world, you just need to call them on main function
