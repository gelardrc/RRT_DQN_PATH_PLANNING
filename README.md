# Adaptive Path Planning for UAS Fusing Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees and Deep Reinforcement Learning in an Agriculture Dynamic Environment

**Author:** Gabriel G.R Castro

**Abstract** : Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) is a suitable solution for monitoring the growing cultures due to the possibility of covering a large area presented in this kind of scenario and the necessity of periodic monitoring. In inspection and monitoring tasks, the UAS must find an optimal or near optimal collision-free route given initial and target positions. In this sense, path planning strategies are crucial, especially online path planning that can represent the robotâ€™s operational environment or even for controlling purposes. Therefore, this research proposes an online adaptive 3D path planning
solution based on the fusion of Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to be applied in the autonomous trajectory of UAS during the inspection of an olive-growing environment. The proposed framework was tested in a simulated environment
using Gazebo and ROS. The results showed that the proposed solution accomplished the trial for 91.2% of the test environment.

**1 - Requirements :**  <a name="requeriments"></a>

Firsts things first, you need to have install into you computer (offboard controller) ROS melodic. Just follow the ROS Wiki tutorials above: 

http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu

http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment

With your ROS system installed and catkin space configured, we will install PX4 ros package. Follow the tutorials in PX4 site above : 

(I recommend to install via ubuntu_sim_ros_melodic.sh, and to download Firmware into your catkin space !!)

https://dev.px4.io/v1.11_noredirect/en/setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.html

Now install mavros (in this work I installed from source, without problem)

sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-mavros ros-melodic-mavros-extras

obs : You will probably need to install other standard ros-packges, like rospy and some gazebo messages. Since they fit in any project, you probblaby will have them already installed into your ros workspace

**2 - Project Structure :**  <a name="structure"></a>

This project has the structure of a catkin-ros package where : 

Directorys:

Models -- >  Contain the models used in simulations ( most of them are already in gazebo standard models, but these has little changes)

Launch -- >  Has the compile of nodes you need to use to Start simulations and tests for this project

Scripts -->  Is where the actually python and jupyternotebooks are stored

Worlds  -->  Contain the files that describe the worlds in gazebo simulation

data    -->  Contain some infomation about the data acquired during tests and simulations

**3 - Scripts files :**  <a name="scripts"></a>

The work has four major pieces of codes, that can be found in scripts file.

Alg_trieno_python_simu.ipynb -- > Is the notebook used that actually train the DQN, save and create the file last_brain.pth, that is the DQN saved model.

agent.py --> Is where we start all things atached to the agent like sensores, mission messages, actions and son on.....

world_builder --> Is the core of the simulation, it started gelo.launch (px4+mavros nodes) and create and attualize the envionment in gazebo.

mission_planner.py --> That is just a normal RRT implementation, but taking into account the models create in world_builder. It also sends a message to agent.py, with the planned mission.

That is how the nodes commucate to each other using ROS messages and topics.
