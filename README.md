**Abstract** : Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) is a suitable solution for monitoring the growing cultures due to the possibility of covering a large area presented in this kind of scenario and the necessity of periodic monitoring. In inspection and monitoring tasks, the UAS must find an optimal or near optimal collision-free route given initial and target positions. In this sense, path planning strategies are crucial, especially online path planning that can represent the robotâ€™s operational environment or even for controlling purposes. Therefore, this research proposes an online adaptive 3D path planning
solution based on the fusion of Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to be applied in the autonomous trajectory of UAS during the inspection of an olive-growing environment. The proposed framework was tested in a simulated environment
using Gazebo and ROS. The results showed that the proposed solution accomplished the trial for 91.2% of the test environment.

Firsts things first, you need to have install into you computer (offboard controller) ROS melodic. Just follow the ROS Wiki tutorials above: 

http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu

http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment

With your ROS system installed and catkin space configured, we will install PX4 ros package. Follow the tutorials in PX4 site above : 

(I recommend to install via ubuntu_sim_ros_melodic.sh, and to download Firmware into your catkin space !!)

https://dev.px4.io/v1.11_noredirect/en/setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.html

Now install mavros (in this work I installed from source, without problem)
